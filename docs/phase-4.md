## Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization

#### Frontend:

- Implement lazy loading for images and videos.
- Minimize JavaScript and CSS bundles using tree-shaking.
- Use CDN for static assets.
- Optimize rendering with React’s Suspense and useMemo/useCallback hooks.

#### Backend:

- Use caching for frequently requested data (e.g., course catalog, user dashboards).
- Optimize database queries with indexing and query optimization.
- Implement pagination for large datasets (e.g., discussions, reviews).

#### Database:

- Analyze and resolve slow queries using a query performance analyzer.
- Archive old data to reduce the size of active tables.

---

### 2. Mobile App Development

#### Technology Stack:

- Framework: React Native (to leverage shared code with the web app).
- Backend: Reuse existing APIs with mobile-specific enhancements if needed.

#### Features:

- Replicate core functionalities:
  - Course catalog and purchase.
  - Live and recorded content access.
  - Discussions and feedback.
- Mobile-friendly UI adjustments:
  - Simplified navigation.
  - Push notifications for reminders and updates.

#### Deployment:

- Use Apple Developer and Google Play accounts to publish apps.
- Test extensively on multiple devices and screen sizes.

---

### 3. Expanded Payment Options

#### Integrations:

- Add Stripe as an alternative to MercadoPago.
- Enable support for multiple currencies and local payment methods.

#### Features:

- Allow users to select a preferred payment method.
- Display currency conversion rates during checkout.

---

### 4. System Monitoring & Analytics

#### Tools:

- Integrate application performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
- Use Google Analytics or Mixpanel for user behavior tracking.

#### Metrics:

- Monitor key performance indicators:
  - Server response times.
  - Error rates.
  - User engagement (e.g., time spent, courses completed).
- Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., payment failures, high server load).

---

### 5. Scalability Enhancements

#### Backend:

- Implement horizontal scaling for the Node.js server using load balancers.
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployments.

#### Database:

- Scale the database with read replicas for high-traffic scenarios.
- Enable auto-scaling for database instances.

#### Infrastructure:

- Use a cloud provider’s auto-scaling features for hosting.
- Optimize costs by analyzing resource usage and downgrading underutilized services.

## Testing

### Functional Testing:

- Test performance under high load scenarios.
- Validate mobile app functionality and responsiveness.
- Test new payment methods and currency conversion.

### Security Testing:

- Conduct vulnerability assessments on the web and mobile apps.
- Ensure secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., payment info, personal data).

### User Testing:

- Gather feedback on mobile usability.
- Monitor user satisfaction with new payment options and app performance.

---

## Deployment

### Staging:

- Test optimizations and new features in a staging environment.
- Perform load testing to ensure readiness for production traffic.

### Production:

- Roll out updates incrementally to monitor performance.
- Use blue-green deployments to minimize downtime.
