### 4. Administrator Tools

#### Backend:

## Testing

### Functional Testing:

- Verify discussion threads and replies flow correctly.
- Ensure reviews are submitted and displayed accurately.
- Test upvote functionality and interaction tracking.

### Security Testing:

- Validate user authentication for posting and upvoting.
- Ensure flagged content is reviewed before deletion.

### User Testing:

- Collect feedback on discussion board usability.
- Test user motivation with interaction features (e.g., upvotes, badges).

## Deployment

### Hosting:

- Ensure discussion board and review APIs are optimized for performance.
- Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., top threads, course ratings).

### CI/CD:

- Add automated tests for discussion and review features.
- Deploy incrementally with monitoring for user activity spikes.

## Deliverables

1. Fully functional discussion boards with threads and replies.
2. Course review system with average ratings and user feedback.
3. User interaction features like upvotes and activity tracking.
4. Administrator tools for content moderation.
